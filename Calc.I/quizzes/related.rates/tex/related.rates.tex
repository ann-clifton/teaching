\begin{thm}
  The volume of a tree is given by \(V = \dfrac{1}{12\pi}C^2h\), where \(C\) is the circumference of the tree in meters at ground level, and \(h\) is the height of the tree in meters.
  Both \(C\) and \(h\) are functions of time, \(t\), in years.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
    Find a formula for \(\dfrac{\dif V}{\dif t}\).
    What does it represent in practical terms?
    \vspace{2in}
  \item
    Suppose the circumerence grows at a rate of \(1/5\) meter per year, and the height grows at a rate of \(4\) meters per year.
    How fast is the volume of the tree growing when the circumference is \(5\) meters and the height is \(22\) meters?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
