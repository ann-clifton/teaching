\begin{thm}
  What is the maximum vertical distance between the line \(y = x + 2\) and the parabola \(y = x^2\) for \(-1 \leq x \leq 2\)?
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  What is the minimum vertical distance between the parabolas \(y = x^2 + 1\) and \(y = x - x^2\)?
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  A box with a square base and open top must have a volume of \(32,000\ \text{cm}^3\).
  Find the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of material used.\\
  {[Hint: If you use the prime factorization \(32,000 = 2^8 5^3\), your computations will be \textit{much} simpler.]}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  If \(1200\ \text{cm}^2\) of material is available to make a box with a square base and an open top, find the largest possible volume of the box.

\begin{thm}
  Find the points on the ellipse \(4x^2 + y^2 = 4\) that are farthest away from the point \((1,0)\).
