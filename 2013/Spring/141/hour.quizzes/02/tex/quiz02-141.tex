\begin{thm}[1 Point]
  A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1000 milliliters of liquid.
  Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the material used to manufacture the can.
  
  [If $r$ is the radius of the base of the cylinder, and $h$ the height of the cylinder, then surface area and volume of a cylinder are given by $A(r, h) = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h$ and $V(r,h) = \pi r^2 h$.]
