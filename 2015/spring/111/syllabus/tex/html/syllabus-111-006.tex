Sessions are open to all students who want to improve their understanding of the material, as well as their grades. SI Sessions will focus on the most recent material covered in class. Each SI Leader holds three sessions per week. Your SI Leader is Ryan Dyckes and you can find her session schedule online at \url{http://www.sa.sc.edu/ssc/supplementalinstruction/si-schedule}. You can also contact the Student Success Center at (803) 777-1000 if you have questions about the SI Session schedule.\\
